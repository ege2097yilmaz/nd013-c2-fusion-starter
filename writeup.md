# Writeup: Track 3D-Objects Over Time

Please use this starter template to answer the following questions:

### 1. Write a short recap of the four tracking steps and what you implemented there (filter, track management, association, camera fusion). Which results did you achieve? Which part of the project was most difficult for you to complete, and why?

- **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF):** Implemented EKF for state estimation of tracked objects.
- **Track Management:** Managed object tracks' lifecycle (creation, updating, deletion).
- **Data Association:** Associated sensor measurements with object tracks.
- **Camera-Lidar Sensor Fusion:** Fused camera and lidar data to enhance tracking accuracy.

Results Achieved:

Improved object tracking accuracy and robustness, particularly in challenging scenarios like occlusions and sensor noise.

Most Difficult Part:

Data association was the most challenging due to the complexity of accurately matching sensor measurements with existing tracks.

### 2. Do you see any benefits in camera-lidar fusion compared to lidar-only tracking (in theory and in your concrete results)? 
- **Theoretical Benefits:** Combining camera and lidar data provides complementary information, enhancing tracking accuracy and robustness.
- **Concrete Results:** Camera-lidar fusion improved tracking performance, especially in varying lighting conditions and occlusions.

### 3. Which challenges will a sensor fusion system face in real-life scenarios? Did you see any of these challenges in the project?
- **Sensor Heterogeneity:** Variability in sensor accuracy and noise requires sophisticated fusion algorithms.
- **Environmental Variability:** Real-world conditions like weather, lighting, and occlusions pose challenges to sensor fusion systems.
- **Computational Complexity:** Real-time processing of data from multiple sensors demands efficient algorithms and hardware.

Challenges observed based on my real experience that I faced before.

### 4. Can you think of ways to improve your tracking results in the future?
- **Enhanced Sensor Calibration:** Improving sensor calibration reduces errors and enhances fusion accuracy.
- **Advanced Fusion Algorithms:** Implementing more sophisticated fusion algorithms, such as deep learning-based approaches, can further improve tracking performance.
- **Robust Data Association Techniques:** Developing robust data association methods better handles challenging scenarios like occlusions and sensor failures.
